### 1. INTRODUCTION 
Our game name is PROSOMOIOSI which is the word for simulation in Greek. We chose this name because our game is situated that you are inside a simulation in which your objective is to discover that you are in a simulation and try to get outside of this simulation. 

Now that you know what is the context of our game let’s dig into the problems we had during the progress of completing this game. The first dilemma that we had was to choose to use the file JSON or not, in our case, we decided to not ot use it because we hadn’t used it before. Another important problem we had was how to structure the information we wanted to be taken from the text file, this problem was solved by trying many different formats until our functions worked.

#### 3.4 DATASET DESCRIPTION AND PROCESSING 
Each scenario has a text file for itself. The information about skills is also saved in a text file, in this text file we have saved both the information about the skills of the characters and the enemies. And for saving the game at a certain point we also use a certain structure. All this information is in the file name format.txt. 

![](Images_markdown/skillstxt.png)

We have the number of skills, then we have the description of the skill, we have of what type it is, then we have the basic damage of the skill, we have the first letter of the modifier that it has, and then, at last, we save the damage, defense, and health the skill provide.

For the scenario, we follow the format provided in the image above. First, we have the node number, then the description of the decision, then we have the pre-text and then we have the enemy information with its name and the skill numbers that he has. After this, we have the post-text and the 2 descriptions for the next options the user can choose.

To save the game, we follow we save the character name, the stat they had damage defense and health, the number of skills that they were using, the last node number that they played, and at last we save the last_scenario that he played. 

### 4. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
We have searched for information about different things on the internet we will put the link below to the consulted sites.  All the material from the theory classes was very useful. We have also made use of AI, especially Chat Gpt. The functions provided by Chat Gpt have been commented on as provided by Chat Gpt in the project code.  Most of the logical part was done by us but we asked them to improve our reasoning or to know what problems our algorithms could have. We also asked Chat Gpt for boundary cases for some functions.

### 5. REFERENCES
We principally looked at information provided in the theory class.  All the information about stack and queue, the sorting algorithm was useful and the theory we have seen about the graphs was also very useful. We would like to thank also our professor for the Lab sessions because he helped us clear our doubts regarding many things that we questioned during the process of making the games.
